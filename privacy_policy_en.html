					California for the purpose of litigating any dispute. We make no representation that the Service or any Materials
					included in the Service are appropriate or available for use in your location.</dd>

				<dt>General.</dt>
				<dd>You agree that the Service shall be deemed a passive website that does not give rise to personal
					jurisdiction over DJI, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. These Terms and any other
					agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement
					between you and DJI regarding your use of the Service. Except as expressly permitted above, these Terms may be amended
					only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of all parties to these Terms. You may not assign or
					transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without
					our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require
					performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a
					waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent
					breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and
					will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or
					unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will
					remain in full force and effect. Upon termination of these Terms, Sections 1 and 4 through 19, along with the Privacy
					Policy and any other accompanying agreements, will survive.</dd>

			<dl>
				<dt>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</dt>
				<dd>
					<p><strong>1. Generally.</strong> In the interest of resolving disputes between you and DJI in the most expedient and cost effective
						manner, you and DJI agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding
						arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a
						judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.
						Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes
						all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,
						misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination
						of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND DJI ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A
						TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
					<p><strong>2. Exceptions.</strong> Despite the provisions of Section 17.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or
						otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an
						enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek
						injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property
						infringement claim.</p>
					<p><strong>3. Arbitrator.</strong> Any arbitration between you and DJI will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by
						the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes
						(collectively, “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”) of the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”), as modified by these Terms, and will be
						administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at
						1-800-778-7879, or by contacting DJI.</p>
					<p><strong>4. Notice; Process.</strong> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the
						other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not
						provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“<strong>Notice</strong>”). DJI’s address for Notice is: 14th Floor, West
						Wing, Skyworth Semiconductor Design Building, No.18 Gaoxin South 4th Ave, Nanshan District, Shenzhen, China, 518057. The
						Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought
						(“<strong>Demand</strong>”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an
						agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or DJI may commence an arbitration proceeding.
						During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or DJI must not be disclosed to the arbitrator
						until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through
						arbitration in your favor, DJI will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if
						any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by DJI in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s
						award; or (iii) $1,000.</p>
					<p><strong>5. Fees.</strong>If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, DJI will reimburse you for your payment of the
						filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA
						Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco County, California, but
						if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis
						of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person
						hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that
						either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose
						(as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be
						governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse DJI for all monies previously disbursed by it that are
						otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted,
						the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on
						which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment
						and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within
						14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>
					<p><strong>6. No Class Actions.</strong> YOU AND DJI AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL
						CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless
						both you and DJI agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not
						otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
					<p><strong>7. Modifications of This Arbitration Provision.</strong> If DJI makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other
						than a change to DJI's address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the
						change to DJI’s address for Notice, in which case your account with DJI will be immediately terminated and this
						arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</p>
					<p><strong>8. Enforceability.</strong> If Section 17.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 17 is found to be
						unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 16 (other than, in the latter case, Section 17.6) will be null and void
						and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 15 will govern any
						action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>
