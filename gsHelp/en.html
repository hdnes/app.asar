<h2 id="toc_2">1. What is DJI Ground Station?</h2>

<p>DJI Ground Station, hereinafter referred to as Ground Station, is one of the most important component of DJI Assistant. It allows you to manipulate DJI aircrafts with Windows devices. More, it also enables multi-aircraft handling and some industrial applications. You can preset some routes and then allocate to multiple aircrafts, and monitor and control the execution status of each route on screen.</p>

<p>The brand new Ground Station comprehensively improves in Flight and Plan Module, with support for A3 Flight Controller System, D-RTK, and DATALINK-PRO. You can switch to different modules as you need, and each module has its independent interface and function. Additionally, you are also allowed to adjust Ground Station settings here. </p>

<p>With its powerful flight controller system and Ground Station Protocol, the new Ground Station will be widely applied as prospected in a great many fields, including aerial photography, mapping, geoexploration, security patrols, disaster monitoring, meteorological detection，agricultural plant protection, and line overhauls.</p>

<p>DJI Ground Station automatically chooses Google Map or Amap according to PC&#39;s IP address or GPS Location. For instance, system chooses Amap as the map source when the GPS signal acquired by the aircraft is in China. Otherwise, Google Map will be chosen.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h3 id="toc_7">4.2 Data Display</h3>

<p>In <strong>Plan</strong> Module, select any one waypoint. Its longitude and latitude will emerge on the map.</p>

<p>In <strong>Flight</strong> Module, select any one waypoint. The popup of waypoint information will emerge on the map.</p>

<p>With the map zoomed in/out, the scale will also zoomed out/in. When the map is zoomed in to a certain degree, information of some waypoints and routes will be simplified or hidden.</p>

<p>The route information is displayed at the bottom of Map Zone, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Route name</li>
<li>Total length</li>
<li>Estimated flight time</li>
<li>Numbers of current used/total available waypoints (In <strong>Plan</strong> Module)</li>
<li>Numbers of photos/totally needed photos (In <strong>Flight</strong> Module)</li>
</ul>

<p><br></p>

<h3 id="toc_8">4.3 Map Tool</h3>

<p>You can click on the map tools to do corresponding operations, including <strong>Search</strong>, <strong>Map Type</strong>, <strong>Zoom In/Out</strong>, and <strong>Back</strong>.</p>

<p>DJI Ground Station allows both mouse- and touch-based operations. You can just use mousewheel or two fingers to zoom in and out the map, or click/tap and drag any point on the screen to move the map.</p>

<h4 id="toc_9">4.3.1 Search</h4>

<p>Click <strong>Search</strong>. A search box pops up. You can type in a place name or the longitude and latitude of the place, and then click <strong>OK</strong>. The map automatically moves where the place centering the map.</p>

<p>Ground Station can automatically decide whether to change the map source according to the location you type in. For instance, If an American use is searching a place in China with this system, the map source will automatically change to Amap. </p>

<h4 id="toc_10">4.3.2 Map Type</h4>

<p>You can also enter <strong>Multiple Mode</strong> in the Bottom Status Bar. Select an unselected waypoint, or click a selected one to cancel selection. You can also click <strong>Select All</strong> to directly select all waypoints or cancel all selection.</p>

<h4 id="toc_24">5.2.4 Set a Waypoint</h4>

<p>All parameters of the current waypoint is displayed in Right Properties Bar, enabling you to make specific settings. When multiple waypoints are selected, you can set all contemporarily.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Waypoint Properties</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Height</strong>： The start point is 40m by default. The aircraft will smoothly fly to the next waypoint when the height is different. The lowest height supported by Main Controller is 2m.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Angle</strong>：The clockwise angle between the aircraft head and the wayline only when you customize the <strong>Turn Mode</strong> in <strong>Wayline Properties</strong>. You can choose 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°, or customize the value.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><em>Auto Shoot:</em></strong> <em>You can set auto time-fixed or distance-fixed shoot between two waypoints. You can choose 3s, 5s, or 10s for time interval. When the image format is JPEG, 3s is recommended. 5s is preferred when it is in Raw. If the format is JPEG+RAW, we suggest 10s. The minimum distance of Distance-fixed shoot is 6m, so that too small distance may lead to shoot failure. Auto Shoot will also fail between two waypoints when the time you set is longer than the flight time, or when the distance you set is larger than the that between the two. It only captures one photo at the beginning waypoint.</em></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Waypoint Action</em></strong> </p>

<p>You can select the action of the aircraft when it is in the waypoint, including <strong>Hover</strong>, <strong>Take Photo</strong>, <strong>Start/stop Recording</strong>, <strong>Pan Aircraft</strong>, <strong>Tilt Gimbal</strong>, and <strong>Qui-direction Shoot</strong>.

<p><strong>Note</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>The system supports 16 actions for one waypoint at most, which will be automatically checked when you upload your route. Warning will be triggered if it exceeds 16. </li>
<li>*You can use <strong>Qui-direction Shoot</strong> when surveying. It rapidly shoots from 5 directions (downward, forward, left, backward, and right), enabling to compose a 3D map later. As is a combined action, it accounts for 9 waypoint actions.*</li>
<li>*When you add the action <strong>Take Photo</strong> after <strong>Start Recording</strong>, <strong>Stop Recording</strong> will be automatically added, which also accounts for one action.*</li>
